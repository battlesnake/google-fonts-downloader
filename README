Google Fonts downloader script

Usage:
	curl "Google Fonts stylesheet" | ./extract.pl > fonts.txt

The stylesheet is the URL from the "<link href='url' ...>" or "@import url(url)" code given by the Google Fonts service.

The fonts.txt file (or STDOUT if none specified) is replaced by a tab-separated table of all data read from the stylesheet.

The fonts are saved to "./{FACE}/{STYLE-WEIGHT.FORMAT}"
eg: "./Roboto/normal-900.woff"

Examples of both the input and output files are given in extract-eg.css and extract-eg.txt respectively
